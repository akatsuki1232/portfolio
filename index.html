                in a secret experiment and possesses the ability to read people's minds. Her dark 
                past and the way she coped with it is certainly one reason why fans are so fond of her.

                <h3>I AM A STUDENTS</h3>
                <P><B><i>Anya is a short young girl with fair skin and green eyes. 
                    Loid describes her as appearing about four to five years old at the oldest.[8] 
                    Her green eyes are large and oval-shaped with prominent eyelashes. She has shoulder
                    -length, light pink hair that curls inwards with a fringe that reaches just above her eyes and a small 
                    strand of ahoge at the top of her head. Anya is noticeably shorter than most of her peers, and many of the insults 
                    that Damian and his friends target her small size. However, in Damian's view, she gains a prettier appearance.
                     When Loid met Anya for the first time in the orphanage, she wore a simple black dress with a white ribbon 
                     at the front, along with white folded-down socks and black shoes. She also wears two black hair ornaments 
                     with bright yellow embellishments resembling small horns on the sides of her head. Anya is never seen with 
                     her hair ornaments off, even wearing them to sleep.

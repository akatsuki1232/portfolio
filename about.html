    <P><B><i>Anya is a short young girl with fair skin and green eyes. 
        Loid describes her as appearing about four to five years old at the oldest.[8] 
        Her green eyes are large and oval-shaped with prominent eyelashes. She has shoulder
        -length, light pink hair that curls inwards with a fringe that reaches just above her eyes and a small 
        strand of ahoge at the top of her head. Anya is noticeably shorter than most of her peers, and many of the insults 
        that Damian and his friends target her small size. However, in Damian's view, she gains a prettier appearance.
         When Loid met Anya for the first time in the orphanage, she wore a simple black dress with a white ribbon 
         at the front, along with white folded-down socks and black shoes. She also wears two black hair ornaments 
         with bright yellow embellishments resembling small horns on the sides of her head. Anya is never seen with 
         her hair ornaments off, even wearing them to sleep.</i></B></P>
